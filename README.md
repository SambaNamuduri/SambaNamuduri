# Samba Namuduri 

- Hello! 👋🏼 My name is Samba Namuduri from India. Working as a Software Engineer. 💻

- I build user-friendly web UIs with modern JavaScript libraries like jQuery, breathing life into the applications I create. Leveraging Spring, Java, and SQL scripts, I develop robust and scalable systems, crafting RESTful APIs and seamlessly integrating with diverse databases and other services. My expertise extends to designing and managing efficient SQL schemas, optimizing queries for swift data retrieval and maintaining data integrity.

Furthermore, I am passionate about continuous improvement, actively adopting best practices, standards, and tools in software engineering and DevOps. Fostering collaboration, I participate in code reviews, pair programming, and agile practices to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing. My commitment to quality extends to utilizing SonarQube for code testing and remediation. Additionally, I contribute to internal tools by ingesting data from application server and database logs using Spring Integration.
